Hello, my name is Natasha, and I'm a person who plans everything, but something always happens, and my plans break (and then I suffer and get depressed). I always wanted to move from Russia. I had plenty of ideas, thoughts, and sometimes opportunities to do that, it never really happened until this time.

Immigration and relocation is not an easy process, especially during a pandemic. I am sure that many of those who relocated have 1001 stories about how they moved, but ours is just very weird and unusual. I don't even know where to start because I can't share one part of this story, and it deserves special attention, so I'll start somewhere in the middle but will capture the background.

Back in April 2019, I started planning a relocation to Amsterdam with the company I worked in (a huge and pretty popular tech company). From that time, I lived in the "waiting mode" (I decided not to buy an apartment, didn't rent a new apartment, and so on). Although the relocation paperwork process has not yet been launched, there have already been some agreements. In the fall of 2019, my husband and I even went to Amsterdam to check it out once again, talk to my uncle, who has been living there for more than 20 years, reviewed everything related to health insurance and what's not. 
And then a lot of things happened that did not depend on me, and I never went to Amsterdam. In fact, as I wrote at the beginning, I have been living in this "waiting mode" almost my whole life. I was always almost moving somewhere, but something happened in the last moments, and I didn't move. I was very tired of living in this feeling, I really wanted to leave, and I had the opportunity to go to Canada with my husband's (D.). And now the story begins!

We managed to get our visas right before COVID happened and a few weeks before they started to close all the borders. So we got stuck in Russia with valid work visas. In general, even then, although it caused my strong reactions and regular tears, it gave me the belief that while we were waiting, something might change, and we could still move to Amsterdam. While the borders were closed, D. decided to change his last name. He wanted to do it for a long time, and he had his reasons.

Of course, before even starting to apply for a new last name, we consulted with the immigration lawyers who handled the entire moving process. They said that he could go ahead and change his last name; there should be no issues since The USA and Canada usually allow people to enter the country with an old and valid visa. The main thing is that it is still the same person. While the process of changing the last name was in progress, Canada opened its borders and allowed it to enter the country for those who have work visas. When D. finally received all the new documents, he wrote an email to the lawyers to inform them that we were ready to fly. The first thing that surprised me was that the lawyers thought we had been in Canada for a long time already and were changing the last name inside the country (not cool).  Well, fine, in general, they wrote again that everything was ok, but if we were too worried, we could write an email to the visa office and find out if they could re-issue the visa into a new passport. Unfortunately, they said they would not do it, and if we want to get a new visa, we need to reapply. 
It took us a couple of weeks to get a visa before Covid happened, and now the process can take up to six months, so the lawyers advised us to just go with the current documents because, as they said in advance, there should be no issues at the border. The only ones who might have questions were the airline, so the lawyers prepared a document that explained the situation to prevent that from happening.

So, let's skip everything that I felt when I quit (it was terribly difficult and took me an endless number of sleepless nights), goodbyes, accepting that we were not moving to Europe, but to another continent ( although I dreamed about it very much, but the older I got, the more I wanted to go to Europe. Also I had a lot of friends and relatives there, and would be close to my parents).

Perhaps the scariest part before the trip was not to get Covid, because, in addition to the fact that the Covid itself is already very bad, it would also postpone the trip once again (we have been in the "waiting stage" for a year already). Well, ok, I will drop this part of the story again, although I must admit that my nervous system could not stand it all and had to start taking tranquilizers to live through it all. I calmed myself down; I hoped that we would move soon, arrive, and finally, I could just relax and come to my senses after all the hell that I have gone through this year.

On December 1, the moving company has packaged all of our belongings. They prepared two containers: one would travel by air (it would take two weeks to arrive in Canada), another one would travel by sea (it would take two months to arrive). There were two suitcases left for us with some necessary things that we would take on board. It is also worth mentioning that on December 1, we discovered that Canada requires additional confirmation for a person who travels as a family (me), which I didn't have, of course. The lawyers assured us that since we received visas before Covid, that rule didn't concern me since I would be traveling using a work visa with an open work permit (and this is very important!). Well, sure, although at that moment, I just wanted to fall into a medical coma before I land on the other continent. But, oh well.

## Point 1 - St.Petersburg, Pulkovo.
We arrived at Pulkovo, showed our documents, and of course, as we expected, there were problems with the last name. Actually, the issue was not related to the visa itself; the system did not allow to pring the boarding pass. In 20 minutes and with the help of the "main" computer, they printed the tickets. They asked us whether we would be allowed to enter Canada with a different last name, we showed a letter from our lawyer, and they let us go. The border control also had no questions. They only asked me for a reason for my trip. I said that it was for work, and when asked where I worked, I said that I work in Toronto, and it worked:) I have an open work permit, I don't have to have a job to enter, but it would be too complicated for Russian board control officers.

## Point 2 - Istanbul.
We had a 9-hour layover in Istanbul. My ex-colleagues told me about the hotel right at the airport, so we could sleep for a while. After getting enough sleep, we went to get ready to fight with the local control service. Because Canada does not let everyone in, the control at the gate was pretty serious. We showed all the documents, but of course, there were questions about the last name. The person who checked our documents took pictures of them and sent them to someone in the What’s app, according to him, he sent it to the Canadian Immigration Services. In our objective opinion, this move is absolutely unsafe. We are not sure that it is legal to take a picture of documents, including a contract with the salary, and send it to someone unknown in What’s app. They asked me if I was traveling as a spouse, I said no because I was going with a work visa. But again, oh well, just let us on board. The plane was departing at 15:45; at 15:40, we still did not know whether they would let us on board. In the end, that man called the Canadian Immigration Service, who asked if D. was the same person or not. And to the answer “yes,” they told him to let us on board immediately. Exactly at 15:45, we got on the plane, the doors closed right behind us.
