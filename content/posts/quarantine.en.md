While I have some free time, I want to tell you about the quarantine in Canada, specifically in Toronto. Before we went to Canada, we read this [article](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/2019-novel-coronavirus-information-sheet.html) about the 14 days of mandatory quarantine for everyone entering Canada. As requested, we prepared a quarantine plan to share with the Officer, but we haven't talked much about the quarantine itself because of our [unusual case](https://natashakatson.github.io/posts/hello-canada/). The Officer just told us to go to our temporary place and be back when the quarantine is over. I was actually mentally prepared for the quarantine; what I was not prepared for mentally was our situation. But I won't talk about it today.

We got Uber and went directly to our place in downtown Toronto. D.'s company rented apartments there in a tall condo building. We knew nothing about the place; we just hoped it would have a balcony so we could "walk around and get some air." It appeared to be nice furnished apartments with cooking supplies and everything a person needs to stay at home. It also had a balcony with a view on a small park.

When we arrived, the receptionist told us about the quarantine and added us to the "quarantine list," which allowed them to leave the deliveries at our doors. Usually, they would ask the residence to pick up the deliveries at the reception (because of Covid). The quarantine means that you should not leave your apartments even if you need to take out the trash. We usually called a company which owned our suit in advance to ask them to take out our trash, put the trash next to our door, and some person took it out. Every morning we checked in the ArriveCan app, which you need to install before going to Canada; either way, they wouldn't let you on board. If you forget to check-in, you'll get a reminder about it. On the 15th day, our profile got reset, and we could finally go outside.

And now I'll share details about some delivery services that we used to survive the quarantine. There are many deliveries here, but it's not easy to quickly get around them with a full understanding of prices and fees. 

TL;DR The cheapest way is to order items directly from the Grocery store. But because of our situation, we were not sure how many things we should order because we didn't know if we would stay here in Canada. 

## Grocery Delivery 

### Uber Eats
The next morning after we arrived, we were too hungry to look around for different options, so we quickly ordered something. We were already familiar with [Uber Eats](https://ubereats.app.link/LfdZFuf8Kcb). The grocery delivery in Uber Eats is actually powered by Cornershop (I will tell about it further) and is done within 1-2 hours. Eventually, Uber Eats turned out to be the most expensive grocery delivery because we paid both the Uber Eats fee and the Cornershop fee.

Summary
- **Walmart (grocery itself)** CA $132.03
- Cornershop service CA $13.20 
- Delivery CA $6.90
- Estimated taxes CA $4.47:
  - Product taxes CA $1.85  
  - Service fee taxes CA $1.72  
  - Delivery fee taxes CA $0.90  
- **Order total** CA $156.60

So it's pretty expensive, but it's ok when you are hungry, stressed out, and can't go out. 

Later I found out that Uber has recently bought Cornershop, but you can still order groceries directly in Cornershop. 

### Cornershop

[Cornershop](https://corner.shop/r/oypnskrr4) also deliver groceries within 1-2 hours. 

One can order groceries from various supermarkets: Walmart, Costco, Longos, Metro, etc. You also get three free deliveries after registration. For some reason, they also gifted me a $20 discount, maybe because I added some items to the basket but didn't order them right away. Even though Cornershop charges a 10% service fee for every order, it's still cheaper than Uber Eats.

Here is my summary

- **Walmart** $79.40
- Cornershop service $7.90
- Delivery Fee Free 
- Estimated taxes: $4.04
  - Product taxes $3.01
  - Service fee taxes $1.03
- Credits applied -$20.00
- **Total** $71.38

We later ordered groceries a few times, I also shared a referral with my husband, and after we placed an order from his account, I got $20 off for my next order.

Please note that if some items are out of stock, they will suggest a replacement. 

### Walmart 

Another delivery that we tried was Walmart delivery. The downside is that you have to place your order a few days before the actual delivery date. But even after you place your order, you can still manage your basket. For example, the delivery was set for noon, but I could change items in my basket until 10 pm of the previous day. Walmart doesn't charge you for service fee, the standard delivery costs $7.97, but you can order the same-day delivery for $10. Unfortunately, if some items are out of stock, you can't choose the replacement; they will do it for you. But if you don't like it, you can always return it.

Summary:

- **Items Subtotal**: $130.77
- Delivery fee :  $7.97
- HST @ 13%:  $2.20
- **Total**: $140.94

## Instacart 

The last but not least grocery delivery that I want to mention is [Instacart](https://inst.cr/t/YjVsWUdYMTBu). My referral link will give you a $10 discount for your first order. I also used a referral link, but I didn't order items from my basket right away..And I got $20 off the next day :) The delivery costs around 5% of the order summary. I liked it that they contacted me in their chat about the items out of stock; this way, it was easier for me to find a replacement. As I previously mentioned, Uber Eats and Cornershop do the same thing, but Instacart representative contacts you directly in live chat, which is nice. 

Summary:

- **Item Subtotal: $93.62**  
- Sales Tax: $0.00  
- Tip: $4.68  
- Service Fee: $4.68  
- Bags Fee: $0.30  
- Retailer Coupon Discount: -$20.00  
- **Total: $83.89**  

All the products were carefully packed, the delivery person left the bags right by the door, knocked, and left.
