      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;ll share my experience of looking for a condo (an apartment) in Toronto. A disclamer: I&amp;rsquo;ll refer to our condo as an apartment just because it sounds more familiar to me.
While we have a temporary place till March 3, we have recently signed a lease to a new place, and we should get the keys on February 17. As a person who has recently moved here from Russia, I still feel that it&amp;rsquo;s all a fraud, but hopefully, this country is more civilized, and a signed lease gives you some guarantees.</description>
