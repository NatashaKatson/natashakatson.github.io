      <description>Hello everyone! I wrote this post about five months ago, but never got around to finishing and publishing it. The time has come! I’ll share my experience with postpartum care for both the child and the mother here.
I didn’t know much about children at all, so I had a hard time imagining how to learn everything and where to get reliable information during those early days when you have no energy for anything (I don’t trust social media bloggers).</description>

      <description>Hello everyone! It’s been a while since I last wrote, and that’s because having a little one at home makes maintaining a full-fledged blog quite difficult. Plus, there weren’t many updates to share. But today, I’m finally writing this post as a permanent resident of Canada!
Yes, it finally happened—we got PR. I’m incredibly happy to write this post! Whee, just two more years and we can finally apply for citizenship.</description>
