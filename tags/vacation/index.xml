      <description>We just got back from our trip to Mexico, and as per tradition, Iâ€™m writing a post about how we spent our time there and how much it all cost.
Why Mexico I&amp;rsquo;ve always had mixed feelings about choosing Mexico as a vacation destination. Most people go there for all-inclusive resorts, and we&amp;rsquo;re not really into that. A big part of our vacations is exploring nature, but I was always told that it&amp;rsquo;s unsafe to rent a car in Mexico and drive around on your own.</description>
