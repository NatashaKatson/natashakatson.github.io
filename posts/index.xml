      <title>Hola, amigo! Vacation in Mexico, not all-inclusive</title>

      <description>We just got back from our trip to Mexico, and as per tradition, I’m writing a post about how we spent our time there and how much it all cost.
Why Mexico I&amp;rsquo;ve always had mixed feelings about choosing Mexico as a vacation destination. Most people go there for all-inclusive resorts, and we&amp;rsquo;re not really into that. A big part of our vacations is exploring nature, but I was always told that it&amp;rsquo;s unsafe to rent a car in Mexico and drive around on your own.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone! It’s been a while since I’ve posted a &amp;ldquo;how am I&amp;rdquo; update.
I’ll start by saying that the fall has arrived, in case you haven’t noticed. The leaves are yellow, and the mood is a bit grey. Though, fall is now much brighter than it used to be because Sam (our son) has his birthday in November. Aside from that, a pile of tasks and worries has come crashing down on me again.</description>

      <title>Postpartum care in Canada</title>

      <description>Hello everyone! I wrote this post about five months ago, but never got around to finishing and publishing it. The time has come! I’ll share my experience with postpartum care for both the child and the mother here.
I didn’t know much about children at all, so I had a hard time imagining how to learn everything and where to get reliable information during those early days when you have no energy for anything (I don’t trust social media bloggers).</description>

      <description>Hello everyone! It’s been a while since I last wrote, and that’s because having a little one at home makes maintaining a full-fledged blog quite difficult. Plus, there weren’t many updates to share. But today, I’m finally writing this post as a permanent resident of Canada!
Yes, it finally happened—we got PR. I’m incredibly happy to write this post! Whee, just two more years and we can finally apply for citizenship.</description>

      <title>How We Rented A Condo in Toronto</title>

      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;ll share my experience of looking for a condo (an apartment) in Toronto. A disclamer: I&amp;rsquo;ll refer to our condo as an apartment just because it sounds more familiar to me.
While we have a temporary place till March 3, we have recently signed a lease to a new place, and we should get the keys on February 17. As a person who has recently moved here from Russia, I still feel that it&amp;rsquo;s all a fraud, but hopefully, this country is more civilized, and a signed lease gives you some guarantees.</description>

      <title>Get Your SIN in Canada</title>

      <description>Finally, we have all the necessary documents (work permit, to be specific) to proceed with further bureaucracy.
Here is how the process usually works. A person lands in Canada with a work visa (let&amp;rsquo;s say during the COVID pandemic). After the arrival, they get a Work Permit at the airport and take a two-week quarantine, which I mentioned earlier. While they in quarantine, they can apply online for a SIN (social insurance number0, contact a bank to get an account, and get employed remotely with their Work Permit.</description>

      <title>The Day When We Finally Got a Work Permit</title>

      <description>Today is the 11th of January, which means that we have to go to the airport to check if there are any news regarding our case. I had insomnia, couldn&amp;rsquo;t eat in the morning, but we finally went to the airport to be there by 2:30 pm.
CBSA office looks similar to the police station (I haven&amp;rsquo;t been at any, but I see it that way). The Officer on duty got our documents and checked if we were who we said we were.</description>

      <title>Quarantine in Toronto </title>
      <link>https://natashakatson.com/posts/quarantine/</link>

      <description>While I have some free time, I want to tell you about the quarantine in Canada, specifically in Toronto. Before we went to Canada, we read this article about the 14 days of mandatory quarantine for everyone entering Canada. As requested, we prepared a quarantine plan to share with the Officer, but we haven&amp;rsquo;t talked much about the quarantine itself because of our unusual case. The Officer just told us to go to our temporary place and be back at the airport when the quarantine is over.</description>

      <title>A Story About One Almost Successful Relocation</title>
      <link>https://natashakatson.com/posts/hello-canada/</link>

      <description>Hello, my name is Natasha, and I&amp;rsquo;m a person who plans everything, but nothing goes according to my plan because of very different circumstances (and then I suffer and get depressed). I always wanted to move from Russia. I had plenty of ideas, thoughts, and sometimes opportunities to do that, but it never really happened until this time.
Immigration and relocation is not an easy process, especially during a pandemic. I am sure that many of those who relocated have 1001 stories about how they moved, but ours is just very weird and unusual.</description>
